/**
 * Where the picture looks: framing everything shown, and following a running
 * acquisition to its newest plane.
 *
 * Two things the page does on its own, each until the operator takes over and
 * each given back with one button:
 *
 * - **Framing.** The view frames every picture shown, again after each tile
 *   that lands, until the operator pans or zooms: then it is theirs, until
 *   Fit is pressed (or Python's fit(), or the 2D/3D switch).
 * - **Following.** While the microscope is acquiring, the view sits on the
 *   newest plane that has arrived, until the operator steps through depth or
 *   time themselves: then it stays where they put it, until Live is pressed.
 *
 * They are independent: zooming into the tile being acquired does not stop the
 * planes from coming, and stepping back through a stack does not stop the view
 * from taking in new tiles.
