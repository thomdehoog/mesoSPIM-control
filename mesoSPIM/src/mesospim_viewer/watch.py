"""What the Data viewer window shows, without the window.

A mesoSPIM run is one folder holding one ``<Sample>.ome.zarr`` group per
acquisition, and inside it one ``(t, c, z, y, x)`` store per tile (see the
``MP_OME_Zarr_TCZYX_Writer``). Tiles appear as they are acquired, and a time
lapse appends time points to the tiles already there.

:class:`Library` is the one model behind the window. It holds a list of
acquisitions -- those of the folder the microscope writes into, and any the
operator opened from disk -- and for each whether it is shown. It keeps a
:class:`~.viewer.Viewer` in line with that list and with the disk:

- the folder the microscope writes into is *watched*: a new acquisition
  appearing in it is shown at once, in place of the one shown before;
- every acquisition that is shown is looked at once a second. A new tile
  becomes a new source; files that landed in a tile already shown are named to
  the page, which reads exactly those (``landing.py``); a tile whose shape
  changed -- a time point appended -- is read again on its own;
- the stack being acquired right now is shown from memory, plane by plane, when
  the microscope feeds its frames in (:meth:`Library.begin_stack`,
  :meth:`Library.add_plane`; see ``live.py``), and the tile on disk takes its
  place once that stack is complete.

Everything works on plain paths and a viewer, so it is tested without Qt; the
window in ``window.py`` drives :meth:`Library.poll` from a timer.
