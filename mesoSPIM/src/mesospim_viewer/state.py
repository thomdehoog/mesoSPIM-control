"""Turning a few placed stores into what the page shows.

Everything here is a pure function from plain data to JSON. An acquisition is a
:class:`Layer` here and becomes one engine layer *per channel*, all sharing the
same sources and composited on the graphics card by their brightness. One layer
per channel is how neuroglancer's own multichannel setup arranges an OME-Zarr,
and the only arrangement that reads a store whose chunks hold one channel each:
the engine reads every channel of a voxel from one chunk, so a channel dimension
across chunks draws nothing. Each source is a neuroglancer source with a
``transform`` carrying its shift.

Each engine layer is described the way neuroglancer itself would write it
(``type``, ``source``, ``shader``, ``shaderControls``...), so
:func:`engine_state` is a state stock neuroglancer restores. The page is given
the same description with three things added, each under a name beginning with
an underscore: which acquisition and channel the layer belongs to, and a
lasting name for every source. With those the page brings a layer into line
*in place* -- one source added, one read again, one control moved -- instead of
building it anew, so a tile landing never blanks the picture or resets a
control (``source/src/layers.js``).

The shader's text is the same for every channel, and what differs -- the
contrast window, the colour -- travels as the values of its controls. A window
measured from the data later is then a control moving, not a new program.
