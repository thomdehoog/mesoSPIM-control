"""
The Data viewer: one window for looking at data, in the View menu.

* **Open Data Viewer** opens the window, or brings it to the front. It watches the
  folder the acquisition list saves into: the newest acquisition is shown, and one
  that starts is shown in its place, plane by plane as the camera delivers it.
* **Open Dataset in Data Viewer...** asks for a dataset on disk and shows it in the
  same window, beside whatever is there.

The window itself is the ``mesospim_viewer`` package beside this module, a
neuroglancer page driven from Python. From disk it reads OME-Zarr, as the
``MP_OME_Zarr_TCZYX_Writer`` (one (t, c, z, y, x) store per tile) and the other
OME-Zarr writers save it. The stack that is being acquired is shown from the
camera's frames, whatever format the run is saved in.

This module is all mesoSPIM-control holds of it: two lines in mesoSPIM_Control.py
call ``prepare_qt`` before the QApplication exists, the two menu actions call
``open_window`` and ``open_acquired_dataset``, and ``Feed`` listens to four signals
the Core and the camera already emit. Nothing in the acquisition waits for the
viewer: a frame is handed over as a thinned-out copy and the rest happens in the
viewer's own threads. PyQtWebEngine is installed with mesoSPIM-control; if it is
missing all the same, the menu entries say how to get it instead of failing.
