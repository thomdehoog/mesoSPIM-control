"""Endpoint presets and timing for the AI Assistant.

The tab's setup offers these providers; choosing one prefills the model (and base URL for
a server), and the operator types the API key into the tab. The key lives in memory for the
session only, never in this file, the microscope config, or a log. An empty key field falls back
to the environment variable named here.

The assistant is built for cloud models (gemini-3.5-flash-lite, claude-haiku-5-5): the history is
append-only until Clear context, every command is offered, and nothing here exists to fit a small
or local model. A local model can still be served through the OpenAI-style preset.

# chat API (Ollama >= 0.22, vLLM, LM Studio, a company gateway) and needs a base URL; a key only
# if that server asks for one.
# context_warn_tokens, context_max_tokens: the history is append-only, so each request carries
# the whole session; the tab shows the last request's input tokens, warns above the first value
# and refuses to start a turn above the second ("Clear context to continue"). Gemini 3.5 and
# Haiku 5.5 take a million tokens; Haiku's price per token rises fivefold on a request above
# 100,000, which is where its warning sits. An OpenAI-style server has no known window.
