"""AI Assistant connector: turns the Remote Control commands into agent tools, runs a
Pydantic AI agent in a worker thread, and blocks each mutating tool until the microscope
actually finishes — so the agent sees completed actions, not 'processing'.

Reuses the shared dispatcher unchanged: every actuation goes through Acceptor.dispatch()
→ validation, movement limits, _GATE.
