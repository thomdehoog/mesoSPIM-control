"""The stack being acquired, fed to the library by the microscope.

mesoSPIM-control says when a stack begins and ends and hands over the camera's
frames in between (:meth:`Library.begin_stack`, :meth:`Library.add_plane`,
:meth:`Library.end_stack`, :meth:`Library.end_run`). The stack is on screen
from memory plane by plane; what the writer saves of that stack meanwhile is
kept from the page -- not served, not announced -- until all of it is on disk,
and then the tile takes the preview's place. Python only, on a clock the tests
move by hand.
